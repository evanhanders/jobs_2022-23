	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {Large-scale convective flows called giant cells were once thought to transport the Sun’s luminosity in the solar convection zone, but recent observations have called their existence into question. In place of large-scale flows, some authors have suggested the solar luminosity may instead be transported by small droplets of rapidly falling, low-entropy fluid. This “entropy rain” could propagate as dense vortex rings, analogous to rising buoyant thermals in the Earth’s atmosphere. In this work, we develop an analytical theory describing the evolution of dense, negatively buoyant thermals. We verify the theory with 2D cylindrical and 3D Cartesian simulations of laminar, axisymmetric thermals in highly stratified atmospheres. Our results show that dense thermals fall in two categories: a stalling regime in which the droplets slow down and expand, and a falling regime in which the droplets accelerate and shrink as they propagate downwards. We estimate that solar downflows are in the falling regime and maintain their entropy perturbation against diffusion until they reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that entropy rain may be an effective nonlocal mechanism for transporting the solar luminosity.}

    abstract = { AbstractEntrainment in cumulus convection remains ill-understood and difficult to quantify. For instance, entrainment is widely believed to be a fundamentally turbulent process, even though Turner (1957) pointed out that dry thermals entrain primarily because of buoyancy (via a dynamical constraint requiring an increase in radius r). Furthermore, entrainment has been postulated to obey a 1/r scaling, but this scaling has not been firmly established.Here, we study the classic case of dry thermals in a neutrally stratified environment using fully resolved direct numerical simulation. We combine this with a thermal tracking algorithm which defines a control volume for the thermal at each time, allowing us to directly measure entrainment. We vary the Reynolds number Re of our thermals between laminar (Re ≈ 600) and turbulent (Re ≈ 6000) regimes, finding only a 20\% variation in entrainment rate ɛ, supporting the claim that turbulence is not necessary for entrainment. We also directly verify the postulated ε ~ 1/r scaling law. }

These are instructional methods that are based on, assessed by, and validated through research on the teaching and learning of physics. They involve students in their own learning more deeply and more intensely than does traditional instruction, particularly during class time. The instructional methods and supporting body of research reviewed here offer potential for significantly improved learning in comparison to traditional lecture-based methods of college and university physics instruction. We begin with an introduction to the history of active learning in physics in the United States, and then discuss some methods for and outcomes of assessing pedagogical effectiveness. We enumerate and describe common characteristics of successful active-learning instructional strategies in physics. We then discuss a range of methods for introducing active-learning instruction in physics and provide references to those methods for which there is published documentation of student learning gains.",

	abstract = {Brightness variations due to dark spots on the stellar surface encode information about stellar surface rotation and magnetic activity. In this work, we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 26,521 main-sequence stars of spectral types M and K in order to measure their surface rotation and photometric activity level. Rotation-period estimates are obtained by the combination of a wavelet analysis and autocorrelation function of the light curves. Reliable rotation estimates are determined by comparing the results from the different rotation diagnostics and four data sets. We also measure the photometric activity proxy  using the amplitude of the flux variations on an appropriate timescale. We report rotation periods and photometric activity proxies for about 60% of the sample, including 4431 targets for which McQuillan et al. did not report a rotation period. For the common targets with rotation estimates in this study and in McQuillan et al., our rotation periods agree within 99%. In this work, we also identify potential polluters, such as misclassified red giants and classical pulsator candidates. Within the parameter range we study, there is a mild tendency for hotter stars to have shorter rotation periods. The photometric activity proxy spans a wider range of values with increasing effective temperature. The rotation period and photometric activity proxy are also related, with  being larger for fast rotators. Similar to McQuillan et al., we find a bimodal distribution of rotation periods.}

abstract="We investigated and compared the learning environment perceptions of students, teachers and guides who participated in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-based outreach activities in secondary education. In outreach activities, schools and teachers work together with companies and other external institutions in learning activities in order to motivate students for the STEM domain. In this study, we identified characteristics of outreach activities that explain variance in perceptions of students. Data were gathered from 729 high-school students as well as 35 teachers and guides in 12 activities both in the US and the Netherlands. A questionnaire was used to asses outreach activities based on subscales from validated questionnaires such as the What Is Happening In this Classroom, Constructivist Learning Environments Survey, Classroom Environment Scale and the Learning Climate Questionnaire. Teachers' perceptions were more positive than students' perceptions for most scales, while guides perceived the outreach learning environment in almost the same way as students. Student perceptions were very positive for outreach activities. Outreach activity characteristics such as teaching method and emphasis were found to be the most important factors in explaining variance in students' perceptions between activities. Long-term problem-based activities and the perspective of new views of science and scientists were perceived as providing the most positive learning environments. Additionally, outreach learning environments can create opportunities to increase students' motivation in STEM.",

abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) linear multistep time-discretization schemes for partial differential equations have proved useful in many applications. However, they tend to have undesirable time-step restrictions when applied to convection-diffusion problems, unless diffusion strongly dominates and an appropriate BDF-based scheme is selected (Ascher et al., 1995). In this paper, we develop Runge-Kutta-based IMEX schemes that have better stability regions than the best known IMEX multistep schemes over a wide parameter range.}

abstract = {This paper presents a method for accurate and efficient computations on scalar, vector and tensor fields in three-dimensional spherical polar coordinates. The method uses spin-weighted spherical harmonics in the angular directions and rescaled Jacobi polynomials in the radial direction. For the 2-sphere, spin-weighted harmonics allow for automating calculations in a fashion as similar to Fourier series as possible. Derivative operators act as wavenumber multiplication on a set of spectral coefficients. After transforming the angular directions, a set of orthogonal tensor rotations put the radially dependent spectral coefficients into individual spaces each obeying a particular regularity condition at the origin. These regularity spaces have remarkably simple properties under standard vector-calculus operations, such as gradient and divergence. We use a hierarchy of rescaled Jacobi polynomials for a basis on these regularity spaces. It is possible to select the Jacobi-polynomial parameters such that all relevant operators act in a minimally banded way. Altogether, the geometric structure allows for the accurate and efficient solution of general partial differential equations in the unit ball.}

 abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) linear multistep methods are popular techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with terms of different types. While fixed timestep versions of such schemes have been developed and studied, implicit-explicit schemes also naturally arise in general situations where the temporal smoothness of the solution changes. In this paper we consider easily implementable variable step-size implicit-explicit (VSIMEX) linear multistep methods for time-dependent PDEs. Families of order-p, p step VSIMEX schemes are constructed and analyzed, where p ranges from 1 to 4. The corresponding schemes are simple to implement and have the property that they reduce to the classical IMEX schemes whenever constant time step-sizes are imposed. The methods are validated on the Burgers' equation. These results demonstrate that by varying the time step-size, VSIMEX methods can outperform their fixed time step counterparts while still maintaining good numerical behavior.},
